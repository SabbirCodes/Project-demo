# Time-based To-Do App (React)

## Overview
A simple time-based to-do app built with React.

## How It Works
1. **Add Task**: Users can add tasks with a time duration (e.g., 1 day or more).
2. **Timer Starts**: The timer starts once the task is created.
3. **Task Completion**: Users mark tasks as completed.
4. **Message Notification**:
   - If completed in time, a congratulatory message appears.
   - If the time expires, a message notifies the user of the incomplete task.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/todo-timer-app.git
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```


## Local Storage Implementation
- Tasks and their completion status are saved in local storage to ensure persistence even after refreshing the page.
